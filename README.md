# OneGlanse

OneGlanse tracks how your brand appears across real AI chat interfaces, stores
responses and citations, and turns them into visibility and source metrics.

This monorepo contains:

- `apps/web` - the main product app
- `apps/agent` - the Camoufox-based worker
- `apps/landing` - the marketing site
- `docs` - the Mintlify documentation source

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10+
- Docker + Docker Compose

## Quick Start

OneGlanse supports three setup paths depending on how you want to run it.

### 1. Use The Cloud App

Open the hosted app directly:

- app: [https://app.oneglanse.com](https://app.oneglanse.com)
- landing: [https://oneglanse.com](https://oneglanse.com)
- docs: [https://docs.oneglanse.com/](https://docs.oneglanse.com/)

Recommended flow:

1. Sign in
2. Create or pick a workspace
3. Connect providers on `/providers`
4. Add prompts your target audience would actually search for
5. Review dashboard, prompt responses, and sources once runs complete

### 2. Run It Locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm local
```

This:

- creates `.env` and `apps/agent/.env` if missing
- bootstraps a pinned local Camoufox package/browser pair automatically on first run
- starts Postgres, ClickHouse, and Redis
- runs database migrations
- starts the web app and the agent locally
- opens the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- forces app mode to `local`

If provider auth is missing, the app routes you to `/providers`.

Local-first auth only:

```bash
pnpm auth
```

That starts the shared providers flow at
[http://localhost:3000/providers](http://localhost:3000/providers) without
running the full app stack. If `3000` is already in use, it automatically picks
the next free local port.

### 3. Self-Host It

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm self-host
```

This starts both self-hosted stacks:

- the main app stack from `docker-compose.yml`
- the always-on public stack from `docker-compose.public.yml`
- forces app mode to `self-host`
- tries to pull the latest published images first
- automatically falls back to a local Docker build if pulling is unavailable

Default ports:

- landing: `http://<host>:3000`
- app: `http://<host>:3001`
- auth upload API: `http://<host>:3333`

Persistent VPS state defaults to `/opt/oneglanse/storage` and is mounted into
the containers as `/storage`. Override it with `ONEGLANSE_STORAGE_ROOT` if your
host should store data elsewhere.

By default, self-hosted compose pulls the published images from:

- `ghcr.io/aryamantodkar/oneglanse-web:latest`
- `ghcr.io/aryamantodkar/oneglanse-agent:latest`
- `ghcr.io/aryamantodkar/oneglanse-postgres:latest`
- `ghcr.io/aryamantodkar/oneglanse-landing:latest`

If those images are unavailable on a target machine, `pnpm self-host` falls
back automatically to `docker compose up -d --build`, so a clean clone on a VPS
can still start with one command and without manual Docker login steps.

If you want to deploy prebuilt images instead, set these env vars before
running the compose helpers:

- `ONEGLANSE_WEB_IMAGE`
- `ONEGLANSE_AGENT_IMAGE`
- `ONEGLANSE_POSTGRES_IMAGE`
- `ONEGLANSE_LANDING_IMAGE`

If you want to build from source instead of pulling published images, use:

- `pnpm self-host:build`
- `pnpm self-host:app:build`
- `pnpm self-host:public:build`

### App-Only Redeploys

Routine product updates should use the default app stack:

```bash
pnpm self-host:app
```

Because `docker-compose.yml` is app-only, `docker compose down` no longer takes
down landing.

### Public-Site Redeploys

Only redeploy the public landing surface when you actually change it:

```bash
pnpm self-host:public
```

### Maintenance Page

The app port is now fronted by an always-on gateway in the public stack. If the
web app is restarting or temporarily unavailable, that gateway serves a short
"Be right back in a few seconds" page instead of a connection error.

## Provider Auth

Provider auth uses one canonical route:

- `/providers`

Supported runtime providers:

- ChatGPT
- Perplexity
- Gemini
- Claude
- AI Overview

Auth groups:

- ChatGPT
- Perplexity
- Google
- Claude

Gemini and Google Search auth are stored separately.

### Local auth flow

1. Open the app or run `pnpm auth`
2. Click a connect button
3. A local Camoufox sign-in browser opens
4. Sign in and close it when done
5. The UI shows a checkmark when that provider auth is saved

### VPS auth flow

The VPS never opens an interactive login browser.

Set these in your local `.env`:

```bash
ONEGLANSE_VPS_IP=YOUR_VPS_IP
AGENT_AUTH_UPLOAD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Then run this on your **local machine**:

```bash
pnpm upload:vps
```

That uploads any existing local auth sessions directly to the VPS without
opening the auth app again.

If you do not have local sessions yet, use:

```bash
pnpm auth
```

If `ONEGLANSE_VPS_IP` and `AGENT_AUTH_UPLOAD_TOKEN` are already set, `pnpm auth`
will first try to upload any existing local sessions. If none exist, it opens
the local provider auth flow, saves the sessions locally, uploads them to the
VPS, and invalidates the matching VPS runtime profiles so the next run reseeds
cleanly.

## Auth and Runtime State

OneGlanse uses both:

- one portable `storageState` bundle per auth group
- one persistent Camoufox runtime profile per runtime provider

The auth bundle is the portable source of truth. Runtime profiles are the
machine-local execution state.

Runtime behavior:

- if a runtime profile is missing, it is seeded from the auth bundle
- if the auth bundle changes, the runtime profile is reseeded
- otherwise the existing persistent profile is reused directly

## Environment Variables

Most variables already have good defaults. In most cases you only need to care
about:

- `.env`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
  - `INTERNAL_CRON_SECRET`
  - `APP_URL`
  - `API_BASE_URL`
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `ONEGLANSE_VPS_IP`
  - `AGENT_AUTH_UPLOAD_TOKEN`
  - `PROXY_*` / `THORDATA_PROXY_API_URL` for VPS proxying
- `apps/agent/.env`
  - `CAMOUFOX_HEADLESS_MODE`
  - `CAMOUFOX_PYTHON_BIN`
  - `CAMOUFOX_PIP_SPEC`
  - `CAMOUFOX_BROWSER_CHANNEL`
  - `DEBUG_ENABLED`

Local bootstrap defaults are pinned to `cloverlabs-camoufox==0.5.5` and
`official/stable/135.0.1-beta.24`. Override those in `apps/agent/.env` only if
you intentionally want to test a different Camoufox package/browser pair.

Deployment mode is controlled by one variable:

- `ONEGLANSE_APP_MODE=cloud|self-host|local`

Behavior:

- `pnpm local` and `pnpm auth` force `local`
- `docker-compose.yml` forces `self-host`
- anything else defaults to `cloud`

Recurring schedule is only available in `self-host` mode. `local` mode
supports manual prompt runs only.

For VPS auth upload, prefer setting `ONEGLANSE_VPS_IP` and
`AGENT_AUTH_UPLOAD_TOKEN` in `.env`, then running `pnpm upload:vps`.

## Docs

Mintlify reads the root `docs/` directory directly. That folder is now the
single docs source for deploys and external documentation hosting.
