# OneGlanse

**The open-source GEO tracker. Free to run. Fully self-hosted. Your data never leaves your machine.**

OneGlanse monitors how your brand appears inside real AI products — ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overview. It is open source, MIT licensed, and costs nothing to run on your own machine or VPS.

**It doesn't call the model API.** It opens the actual ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and AI Overview interfaces in a real browser — the same way a user would — and captures exactly what gets rendered: the full response, inline citations, recommended sources, and how your brand is positioned relative to competitors. API responses omit all of this. OneGlanse captures what users actually see.

**That is the core differentiator.** OneGlanse is built for GEO measurement against production chat surfaces, not benchmark-style API output. The answer visible in ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, or Google AI Overview is often not the same as the raw API completion for the same prompt. The UI layer can add or suppress citations, reorder recommendations, inject product-specific formatting, and change how competitors and sources are presented. If you care about what users actually see, you need the UI response, not just the API response. The same distinction is discussed in Surfer's write-up on [LLM scraped AI answers vs API results](https://surferseo.com/blog/llm-scraped-ai-answers-vs-api-results/).

**After capturing responses, OneGlanse uses OpenAI or Anthropic to analyze them.** Once a prompt run completes, the captured responses are sent to the LLM of your choice (OpenAI GPT or Claude) using your own API key. The LLM extracts GEO scores, sentiment, visibility, rank position, competitor mentions, citation sources, and the AI perception breakdown you see in the dashboard. You bring your own key — the call goes directly from your machine to OpenAI or Anthropic. Nothing passes through any third-party server.

**Your data stays on your machine.** Responses, analytics, and auth sessions are stored in a PostgreSQL and ClickHouse instance you own and control — running locally via Docker or on your own VPS. No data is ever sent to an external server.

**You use your own provider accounts.** OneGlanse authenticates to ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and Google using your own existing logins. No shared credentials. No scraped accounts. Your sessions, stored locally.

The public surfaces are deployed separately:

- `oneglanse.com` (landing site) is deployed on Vercel
- `docs.oneglanse.com` (documentation) is deployed on Mintlify
- the self-host flow in this repo deploys only the app runtime

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Node.js 20+, pnpm 10+, Docker

If you don't have pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm@latest`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryamantodkar/oneglanse
cd oneglanse
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set your LLM API key. This is the only value you must provide — everything else is auto-configured:

```bash
# Pick one:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# or, to use Claude instead:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANALYSIS_LLM_PROVIDER=claude
```

Then start the app:

```bash
pnpm local
```

Opens at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). On first run the script auto-generates secrets, starts Postgres / ClickHouse / Redis, runs migrations, and bootstraps the browser runtime. Sign up with email — Google OAuth is optional and not required.

Once you're in, go to `/providers` to connect your AI provider accounts, then add prompts and run.

## Features

- **5 providers** — ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Overview
- **UI-first capture** — browser automation against real product interfaces, not the API. What users see is what you get.
- **GEO scoring** — visibility, sentiment, rank position, and recommendation type, tracked per prompt over time
- **Competitor co-mentions** — see which brands appear alongside yours and how they're framed
- **Citation tracking** — which domains and articles AI products are citing for your category
- **AI perception analysis** — how models characterize your pricing, key claims, and brand positioning
- **Your own LLM key** — response analysis uses your OpenAI or Anthropic key, called directly from your infrastructure
- **ClickHouse analytics** — high-volume time-series storage built for prompt tracking at scale
- **Self-hosted, free forever** — full stack deploys to any VPS with a single command

**Your overall GEO score, top competitor, rank position, and most-cited sources — in one view.** The dashboard shows your visibility score across all AI models, which competitor co-appears most often alongside your brand, your average rank position across all prompts, and which domains the AI products cite when your category comes up.

**The actual AI response, scored.** Every captured response is tagged with a GEO score, sentiment score, visibility percentage, and rank position. The perception panel on the right extracts how the model is framing your brand: what it says your pricing signal is, what you're best known for, and what specific claims it repeats most often about you.

**Which sources drive your AI presence — and how you compare.** The left panel shows every article and domain being cited about your brand, with the exact article title so you know why that domain ranks. The competitor chart on the right tracks your position against rivals across three dimensions: Presence (are you mentioned), Recommendation (are you recommended), and Sentiment (how positively you're framed).

**Per-prompt breakdown, not aggregated averages.** Every prompt you track gets its own row: GEO score, sentiment, visibility percentage, and rank position. You can see exactly which queries you own and which ones you're losing — and track how both change over time.

## Why There Is No Cloud Version

OneGlanse is built around collecting responses from the real logged-in chat interfaces of ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and Google. That means the product depends on authenticated browser sessions tied to your own provider accounts.

OneGlanse does not use logged-out sessions for GEO tracking because logged-out experiences are materially worse for measuring what real users actually see:

- they are more likely to trigger bot detection or rate limits
- they often return shorter, stripped-down answers
- they frequently hide or reduce citations and source cards
- they can gate richer UI features behind login

That matters because GEO is not just about "did the model mention me". It is also about how your brand is framed, which competitors are shown beside you, and which sources the product actually surfaces to users. Logged-out experiences are thinner and less representative of what real signed-in users see.

That is why we do not offer a hosted cloud product with shared sessions. OneGlanse is designed to run with your own accounts, your own browser sessions, your own proxy setup when needed, and your own infrastructure. It is the more reliable and more accurate way to measure AI visibility without pretending API output or stripped-down logged-out pages are equivalent to the real user experience.

## Why UI-First Instead Of APIs

Most GEO tooling talks about "tracking ChatGPT" or "tracking Gemini" while actually querying model APIs. That is not the same thing.

OneGlanse uses the real chat UIs because those interfaces are where end users see:

- inline citations and source cards
- recommendation ordering
- brand comparisons and product framing
- provider-specific formatting and UI-level post-processing

Those layers are critical to GEO analysis and are exactly the layers that often differ from API output. OneGlanse captures the rendered answer first, then runs analysis on top of that captured UI response.

## Why Camoufox Instead Of Chrome

OneGlanse uses [Camoufox](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox), an anti-fingerprint Firefox-based browser, for provider sessions.

That is a deliberate product decision, not an implementation accident.

AI chat products aggressively defend their web apps against scripted access. In practice, stock Chrome / Chromium automation and generic Playwright browser profiles are much more likely to hit one or more of these failure modes:

- sign-in loops
- forced verification or bot checks
- repeated session invalidation
- blank or degraded responses
- UI flows that work manually but fail under automation

The main issue is not just "browser compatibility". It is the combination of:

- automation fingerprints
- browser fingerprint consistency
- session reputation
- IP reputation

Camoufox gives OneGlanse a browser runtime that is materially better suited for authenticated UI collection against anti-bot-protected chat products. It reduces fingerprint mismatch and makes provider sessions more stable than standard Chrome-style automation in this use case.

Credit to the Camoufox project for making that possible. OneGlanse builds on their work rather than pretending this is solved by plain Playwright + Chrome alone.

## Why Proxies Are Required On VPS

Local runs are usually fine without a proxy because requests come from a normal residential or office IP.

VPS environments are different. Most VPS providers expose datacenter IP ranges, and those ranges are commonly flagged, rate-limited, challenged, or blocked by AI chat products. Even if login works once, ongoing UI automation from a datacenter IP is much less reliable.

That is why self-hosted VPS runs require a residential proxy:

- the VPS still runs the worker and schedule
- browser traffic exits through a residential IP
- provider sites see a normal-looking client origin instead of a datacenter address

Without that proxy layer, provider access from a VPS is often unstable or blocked outright.
